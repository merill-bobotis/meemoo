    <h2>Cat Care Basics</h2>
    <p>Caring for a cat involves providing proper nutrition, a safe environment, regular grooming, and routine veterinary care. Cats are independent animals, but they still require love, attention, and stimulation to stay happy and healthy. Understanding their unique needs will help ensure they thrive in your home.</p>
    <h3>Nutrition and Hydration</h3>
    <p>A well-balanced diet is essential for a catâ€™s health. High-quality cat food, suited to their age and activity level, provides the necessary nutrients. Fresh water should always be available, as proper hydration supports kidney function and overall well-being. Some cats may benefit from a mix of wet and dry food, while others may have specific dietary needs based on their health.</p>
    <h3>Exercise and Mental Stimulation</h3>
    <p>Cats need both physical and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and obesity. Interactive toys, scratching posts, and climbing structures help satisfy their natural instincts. Playtime with their owner strengthens the bond and provides essential exercise. Even indoor cats need opportunities to explore and stay active to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
    <h3>Grooming and Hygiene</h3>
    <p>Most cats groom themselves, but regular brushing helps reduce shedding and hairballs, especially for long-haired breeds. Occasional nail trimming prevents overgrowth and discomfort. Maintaining a clean litter box is also crucial for their hygiene and well-being, as cats prefer a tidy space for their needs.</p>
    <h3>Health and Veterinary Care</h3>
    <p>Routine vet visits ensure your cat stays healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations. Preventative care, such as flea and parasite control, helps avoid common health issues. Watching for changes in behavior, eating habits, or litter box use can help detect early signs of illness. Providing a stress-free environment and regular checkups contribute to a long, happy life for your feline friend.</p>
